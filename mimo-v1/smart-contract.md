# Smart Contract

The smart contract that mimo.exchange uses is based on the [Uniswap's V1 contract](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v1), which has been widely used and tested in practice. Our implementation makes sure it is neither upgradable or own-able. So no worries about anyone can move your assets. We have implemented intensive unit tests around it to make sure the correctness. 

Everyone is welcome to build DeFi based on it.
