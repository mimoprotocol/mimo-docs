# Cross-Chain Trading

mimo.exchange supports trading for any XRC20 tokens, including [ioTube](https://tube.iotex.io) transferred ERC20 tokens.  For any assets supported on ioTube, they can be added to mimo in no time. 

Please refer to ioTube for currently supported assets. 

We are launching mimo-x, a cross chain swap that integrates ioTube, uniswap, mimo to swap between assets on ETH and IOTX.
